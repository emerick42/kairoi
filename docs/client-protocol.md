# Kairoi Client Protocol

## Quick Words

Kairoi clients communicate with Kairoi servers using a protocol called KCP (Kairoi Client Protocol). KCP is a simple request-response UTF-8 encoded text-based protocol over the TCP protocol. It's usually used on the port 5678.

Here is a representative example of a communication between a client and a server, using Kairoi instructions (read more on available instructions in the [Kairoi Instructions documentation](instructions.md)) :

```
Client: A SET app.domain.example_job.0 "2020-05-26 22:26:18"\n
Server: A OK\n
Client: B "UNSET" "app domain ex\\ampl\"e_job 0"\n
Server: B OK\n
```

## Usage

### Request-Response

KCP is a request-response based protocol. The client CAN send requests. The server MUST wait for a client to send a request before sending any message. Requests MUST be identified by the client. Identifiers MUST be unique accross all `active` requests between a single client and the server. The server MUST identify a response using the identifier of the corresponding request.

A request is considered as `active` for the client from the moment it is sent, and as long as it didn't receive an associated response. A request is considered as `active` for the server from the moment it is received, and as long as it didnÂ´t send an associated response.

### Message

The entire content of a request (or a response) is called a message. A message is a sequence of arguments (at least two), separated by any number of spaces (` `), and terminated by the line feed (`\n` or `\U+000A`) character. The first argument of the message is called its identifier. It is used to associate a request to its response.

Here is a visual representation of a message. All sections are separated by spaces:

```
                     Message
+------------+------------+------------+-----+----+
| Identifier | Argument 1 | Argument 2 | ... | \n |
+------------+------------+------------+-----+----+
```

#### Identifier

The identifier of the message SHOULD be unique accross all `active` requests between a single client and the server. The identifier being an argument, its value can be any string (see the next section for more informations on arguments and strings). Although, it SHOULD be as small as possible to lower the impact on performances of the client and the server.

In the case of a request, it is generated by the client and MUST NOT conflict with the identifier of another `active` request.

In the case of a response, the identifier MUST be equal to the identifier of the associated request.

### Argument

Arguments are represented by the only data type defined by this protocol: strings.

### String

A string is a valid sequence of any UTF-8 encoded characters. It can be written in two forms: the simple form, and the universal form.

#### Simple String

Simple strings allow any UTF-8 encoded characters BUT spaces (` `), double-quotes (`"`) and line feeds (`\n` or `\U+000A`).

Here are examples of valid simple strings (one simple string per line):

```
Hello
app.domain$/!#*,toto
IUseEmojis\U+1F631Haha
```

#### Universal String

Universal strings allow usage of literally any UTF-8 encoded characters, but they MUST be surrounded by double-quotes (`"`). It uses backslash (`\`) as the escaping character. Only backslashes (`\`) and double-quotes (`"`) MUST be escaped.

Here are exemples of valid universal strings (one universal string per line):

```
"Hello"
"Hello, world!"
"I can\"con$tain\U+1F631everythi\U+000Ag\\."
```
